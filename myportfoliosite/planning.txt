Inspiration from https://tamalsen.dev/

mobile responsive 1page website.
sections 
1. home/hero
2. expertise - which technologies I work with
3. work - best two-three projects ive made
4. experience/testimonials
contact - simple statement about what I'm looking for work-wise, email, socials.

nav - horizontal layout in wide screens, hamburger in mobile width.
page animation to redirect to different page sections, sticks to top of page below the initial 100vh.
-make burger icon more visible, and larger.
-revisit a solution to keep the scrollbar from spilling onto page content(header)


hero - eye catching font in foreground, high contrasting background
attention grabbing animation to guide the user to scroll down the page


color scheme:
dark background,
dark purple background for every other section row
White, off-white, and light-gray for font-color.
light blue for font emphasis

Polish:
revisit Projects section to display cards better at smaller screen widths.
